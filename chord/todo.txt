1. add data to table. cli function and appropiate message forwarding.
2. when new client is added, assess our hashIds, and see if we need to redistribute data
3. retreive data for specific key
4. close down node function, redistribute keys, tell anchor (anchor tells everyone else)
5. implement cli, do this some as we go because we need to do some testing
